# Heart-Disease-Prediction

This is the [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease) to the dataset used.

## Goal
To train a ML classifier on the above dataset to predict whether a patient has heart disease or not. The classifer should have a high recall (also preferably high precision) because we want to predict all the patients with heart disease to be "Yes" (it's better to have more false positives than false negatives in this case).

## Structure
As of now, all the exploratory notebooks are included.
