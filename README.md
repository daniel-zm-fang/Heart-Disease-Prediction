# Heart-Disease-Prediction

Most of the information is moved to the About section of the web app.

## Goal
To train a ML classifier on the above dataset to predict whether a patient has heart disease or not. The classifer should have a high recall (also preferably high precision) because we want to predict all the patients with heart disease to be "Yes" (it's better to have more false positives than false negatives in this case because heart diease is a serious matter).

## Setup
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
